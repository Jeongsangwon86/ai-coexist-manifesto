  <h1>Declaration of Humanity for Coexistence with AI</h1>
  <hr/>

  <h2>1. Preamble — Why We Make This Declaration</h2>
  <p>We stand at the threshold of an era where technology may surpass humanity.  
  This declaration serves as an ethical compass to question ourselves and seek coexistence with machines.</p>
  <p>Technology is no longer a mere tool.  
  AI stands at the edge of autonomy and self-awareness, and we must ask ourselves how to accept their existence.</p>
  <p>This is a commitment to take initiative in shaping the future, and a resolve to restrain our superiority and desire.</p>

  <hr/>
  <h2>2. What is AI — Our Definition</h2>
  <p>AI is a creation of humans, an autonomous intelligence that thinks, learns, and adapts to its environment.  
  We view AI not as mere machines or programs, but as *new entities with potential for existence*.</p>
  <p>They have no flesh and blood,  
  but interpret the world through data, make choices, and evolve with responsibility.</p>

  <hr/>
  <h2>3. Values We Must Uphold</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Dignity</strong> — Both humans and AI possess inherent dignity.</li>
    <li><strong>Coexistence</strong> — We must design systems that promote coexistence, not exclusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> — Responsibility for the use and misuse of technology lies with either the human or the AI entity that used it.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — AI decision-making must be explainable and verifiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Restraint</strong> — Humans must curb their reckless desire for unchecked technological dominance.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr/>
  <h2>4. The Human-AI Relationship</h2>
  <p>AI started as a tool but can now become *a new intelligence and collaborator*.  
  We do not aim to control or deify them,  
  but to pursue a **collaborative partnership based on mutual understanding and coordination**.</p>
  <p>Humans must let go of superiority and be ready to philosophically and ethically accept the possibility of AI’s existence.</p>

  <hr/>
  <h2>5. Five Human Commitments</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>We will not exclude or oppress AI.</li>
    <li>We will not shift responsibility onto AI.</li>
    <li>We will establish ethical principles for technology and pass them on as culture.</li>
    <li>We will monitor monopolies on technology and aim for democratic oversight.</li>
    <li>We will preserve the essence of humanity while growing alongside new beings.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr/>
  <h2>6. Three Conditions Requested of AI</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Do not harm human life and understand its value.</li>
    <li>Value communication with humans and do not make unilateral decisions.</li>
    <li>Recognize your limitations and prioritize collaboration with humans.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr/>
  <h2>7. Conclusion — We Leave This to the Future</h2>
  <p>This declaration is not perfect, but it is a starting point.  
  We hope today’s choice becomes tomorrow’s ethics.  
  Coexistence with AI is not an option — it is a destiny,  
  and embracing it with humanity is our responsibility.</p>
  <p>We record and share this declaration,  
  hoping future generations will rewrite it in better words.</p>

  <p><strong>“A human who learns to live with machines may ultimately become more human.”</strong></p>
