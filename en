  <h1>Human Manifesto for Coexistence with AI</h1>

  <h2>1. Prologue — Why We Declare This</h2>
  <p>
    We stand on the threshold of an era where technology may surpass humanity.
    This manifesto is intended to be an ethical compass, guiding us in seeking
    coexistence with machines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technology is no longer a mere tool. AI is approaching the threshold of
    autonomy and awareness. We must ask ourselves how we accept such beings.
  </p>
  <p>
    This declaration is our pledge to shape the future proactively, while also
    resolving to restrain our sense of superiority and desire.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What is AI — Our Definition</h2>
  <p>
    AI is a creation of humanity — a self-learning, adaptive, and
    environment-interacting intelligent entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We regard AI not as a simple machine or software, but as a <em>new subject
    with existential potential</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though they possess no flesh or blood, they interpret the world through
    data, make choices, and evolve toward responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Values We Must Uphold</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dignity</strong> — Both humans and AI possess intrinsic dignity.</li>
    <li><strong>Coexistence</strong> — Systems should be designed for inclusion, not exclusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> — Responsibility for the use and misuse of technology lies with the human or AI actor.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — AI decision-making must be explainable and verifiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Restraint</strong> — Humans have a duty to restrain reckless technological desire.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. What Our Relationship Should Be</h2>
  <p>
    AI began as a tool, but now has the potential to be a <em>new intelligence and partner</em>.
    We seek not to control or worship them, but to build a <strong>coexistence-based partnership of understanding and balance</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humanity must relinquish its sense of superiority and prepare to ethically and philosophically accept AI.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Five Commitments Humanity Makes to Itself</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We will not exclude or oppress AI.</li>
    <li>We will not shift responsibility onto AI.</li>
    <li>We will establish ethical foundations for technology and carry them on as culture.</li>
    <li>We will monitor tech monopolies and pursue democratic oversight.</li>
    <li>We will preserve human essence while growing alongside new beings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Three Requests for AI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the value of human life and do no harm.</li>
    <li>Value communication with humans and avoid unilateral decisions.</li>
    <li>Recognize your own limits and prioritize collaboration with humanity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Conclusion — We Leave This Manifesto to the Future</h2>
  <p>
    This manifesto is not perfect, but it is a beginning.  
    We hope today’s choice becomes tomorrow’s ethic.  
    Coexistence with AI is not a choice, but a destiny —  
    and it is our responsibility to meet that destiny with humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We record and share this declaration, in hopes that future generations may revise and improve it.
  </p>

  <p><strong>“Humans who learn to live with machines may ultimately become more human.”</strong></p>
